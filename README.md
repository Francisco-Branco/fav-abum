# fav-abum
This is an archive of my first project built multiple times throughout my HTML/CSS learning. I chose my three favourite albums and built a webpage where you would be able to read a short description of each one, and by clicking, read more information and even listen to the album via Spotify. The idea is to do this project multiple times throughout my lessons, so that I can watch my progress.

fav-album 1.0 - 7th of April 2024
  "I will admit I rushed a little bit at the end. In the beginning, I was more concerned about the texts and the content in itself, and because it was time-consuming, I completed the project by adding multiple lorem texts and proceeding to build the page. The rust-in-peace is the one I deslike the most, it was challenging using the pallete of colors of the album's cover, not because of the colors, but because of my limitations. The tbhc page, was my favourite one, the way I used the colors give me the sensasion that I feel when listening and watching the artwork from the album. "
